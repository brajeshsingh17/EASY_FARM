             Returns is a scheme provided by respective sellers directly under this policy in terms of which the
             option of exchange, replacement and/ or refund is offered by the respective sellers to you. 
             All products listed under a particular category may not have the same returns policy. 
             For all products, the returns/replacement policy provided on the product page shall prevail over
             the general returns policy. <br /><br />

            <h5> General Rules for a successful Return</h5>
            <div>
            1.In certain cases where the seller is unable to process a replacement for any reason whatsoever, a refund will be given.<br />
            2.In cases where a product accessory is found missing/damaged/defective, the seller may either process a replacement of the particular accessory or issue an eGV for an amount equivalent to the price of the accessory, at the sellerâ€™s discretion.<br />
            3.During open box deliveries, while accepting your order, if you received a different or a damaged product, you will be given a refund (on the spot refunds for cash-on-delivery orders). Once you have accepted an open box delivery, no return request will be processed, except for manufacturing defects. In such cases, these category-specific replacement/return general conditions will be applicable. Click here to know more about Open Box Delivery
